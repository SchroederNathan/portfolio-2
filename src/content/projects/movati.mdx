## Overview

Movati Athletic is a Canadian gym chain with locations across the country. Their members needed a modern, mobile-first way to book classes, manage their accounts without calling the front desk or navigating web portals.

I rebuilt their app from the ground up. It now serves over **130,000 users** across Canada.

## The Challenge

Movati had separate native apps for Android and iOS, and both performed poorly. I was tasked with replacing them entirely. The new app needed to:

- Handle real-time class availability across multiple club locations
- Support booking and cancellation with native calendar integration
- Provide full account management (membership details, billing, profile)
- Run seamlessly on iOS, Android, and the web from a single codebase
- Integrate with Movati's existing backend infrastructure

## The Solution

I chose **React Native** and **Expo** to manage all platforms from a single codebase, connected to a **Laravel** API backend. The Laravel backend handles authentication, class scheduling logic, and account data through a clean REST API — keeping the mobile app lightweight while the server handles the heavy lifting.

To streamline releases, I built custom **EAS CI/CD workflows** with CLI commands and GitHub Actions, automating deployment to the App Store, Play Store, and an AWS-hosted web build.

## Key Features

- **Class Scheduling** — Browse upcoming classes by location, time, and instructor. Reserve a spot, cancel, and waitlists with real-time availability updates.
- **Account Management** — View membership details, update profile info, and manage billing — all without calling the front desk.
- **Multi-Location Support** — Switch between Movati club locations and see schedules specific to each gym.
- **Cross-Platform** — One codebase powers iOS, Android, and web with feature parity and a consistent UX across every device.

## Technical Highlights

The app uses **Expo Router** for file-based routing and a truly native navigation experience. State management relies on React's built-in context and hooks — no Redux overhead for an app of this scope. The result is a fast, maintainable codebase that's easy to extend as Movati adds new features.
