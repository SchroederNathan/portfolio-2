## Overview

Movati Athletic is a Canadian fitness club chain with locations across Ontario. Their members needed a modern, mobile-first way to book classes, manage their accounts, and stay connected with their fitness community — without having to call the front desk or log into a clunky web portal.

I built the Movati app to bring that entire experience into members' pockets.

## The Challenge

Movati's existing booking flow was web-based and not optimized for mobile. Members were frustrated with the multi-step process to reserve a spot in popular classes, and the gym's staff was fielding constant calls for account inquiries. The app needed to:

- Handle real-time class availability across multiple club locations
- Support account management (membership details, billing, profile)
- Work seamlessly on both iOS and Android from a single codebase
- Integrate with Movati's existing backend infrastructure

## The Solution

I built a cross-platform mobile app using **React Native** and **Expo**, connected to a **Laravel** API backend. Expo's managed workflow kept the development cycle fast — hot reloading, OTA updates, and a single codebase for both platforms.

The Laravel backend handles authentication, class scheduling logic, and account data, exposing a clean REST API that the app consumes. This architecture keeps the mobile app lightweight while the server handles the heavy lifting.

## Key Features

- **Class Scheduling** — Browse upcoming classes by location, time, and instructor. Reserve your spot with a single tap, with real-time availability updates.
- **Account Management** — View membership details, update profile info, and manage billing — all without calling the front desk.
- **Multi-Location Support** — Switch between Movati club locations and see schedules specific to each gym.
- **Cross-Platform** — One codebase powers both the iOS and Android apps, ensuring feature parity and consistent UX across devices.

## Technical Highlights

The app uses React Native's navigation stack for a fluid, native-feeling experience. Expo's build service handles the CI/CD pipeline, producing signed builds for both app stores. On the backend, Laravel's queue system processes booking confirmations and notifications asynchronously, keeping the API responsive even during peak booking times.

State management is handled with React's built-in context and hooks — no Redux overhead for an app of this scope. The result is a snappy, maintainable codebase that's easy to extend as Movati adds new features.
