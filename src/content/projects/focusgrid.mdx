## Overview

FocusGrid is a habit tracking and productivity app designed to help you build better habits, one day at a time. It's available at [focusgridapp.com](https://focusgridapp.com) and gives users a visual, grid-based system for creating habits, tracking streaks, and staying accountable through social features.

The idea is simple: make habit tracking feel rewarding, not tedious.

## The Challenge

Most habit trackers feel like chores themselves. They're either too complex (20 settings per habit) or too simple (just a checkbox with no context). I wanted to build something in the sweet spot — visually satisfying, easy to use daily, and social enough to keep you motivated without turning into another social media feed.

Key problems to solve:

- Make daily logging fast and frictionless (under 5 seconds)
- Provide meaningful streak tracking that actually motivates
- Add social features without overwhelming the core experience
- Send smart reminders that help without being annoying

## The Solution

I built FocusGrid with **React Native** and **Expo**, focusing on a clean, minimal interface where the grid itself is the main interaction. Each habit gets a cell in your daily grid — tap to log, hold to customize. Streaks build visually, so you can *see* your consistency at a glance.

The social layer is opt-in: share your grid with friends, see their progress, and give each other encouragement. It's accountability without pressure.

## Key Features

- **Habit Creation & Customization** — Create habits with custom names, icons, and frequency goals. Set daily, weekly, or custom schedules that fit your routine.
- **Daily Logging with Streak Tracking** — Tap to log, watch your streak grow. The grid view gives you a bird's-eye view of your consistency over time.
- **Social Sharing & Community** — Share your grid with friends, follow others' progress, and build habits together. Optional and non-intrusive.
- **Daily Reminders & Notifications** — Smart notifications that nudge you at the right time based on your logging patterns, not arbitrary schedules.

## Technical Highlights

Built entirely with React Native and Expo for cross-platform delivery. The grid rendering is optimized for smooth scrolling and quick interactions — no lag when you're rapidly logging your morning habits. Expo's push notification service handles reminders, with scheduling logic that adapts to each user's habits and timezone.

The app uses a component architecture that keeps each habit cell self-contained, making it easy to add new habit types and visualization modes without touching the core grid logic.
