## Overview

FocusGrid is a habit tracking and productivity app I built to make building habits feel rewarding, not tedious. It's available at [focusgridapp.com](https://focusgridapp.com) and has grown to over **1,000 users**.

The concept is simple: a visual, grid-based system where you create habits, track streaks, and stay accountable through optional social features.

## The Challenge

Most habit trackers feel like chores themselves. Either too complex with dozens of settings per habit, or too simple with just a checkbox and no context. I wanted to build something in the sweet spot: visually satisfying, fast enough to use daily, and social enough to keep you motivated without becoming another feed to scroll.

- Make daily logging fast and frictionless (under 5 seconds)
- Provide streak tracking that actually motivates consistency
- Add social features without overwhelming the core experience
- Send smart reminders that help without being annoying

## The Solution

I built FocusGrid with **React Native** and **Expo**, focused on a clean, minimal interface where the grid itself is the main interaction. Each habit gets a cell in your daily grid. Tap to log, hold to customize. Streaks build visually so you can see your consistency at a glance.

## Key Features

- **Habit Creation** — Create habits with custom names, icons, and frequency goals. Set daily, weekly, or custom schedules that fit your routine.
- **Streak Tracking** — Tap to log, watch your streak grow. The grid view gives you a bird's-eye view of your consistency over time.
- **Social Sharing** — Share your grid with friends and build habits together. Optional and non-intrusive.
- **Smart Reminders** — Notifications that nudge you to log your habits.

## Technical Highlights

Built with React Native and Expo for cross-platform delivery. The grid rendering is optimized for smooth scrolling and quick interactions. Expo's push notification service handles reminders.

The app uses a component architecture that keeps each habit cell self-contained, making it straightforward to add new habit types and visualization modes without touching core grid logic.
